	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Binutils version 2.21. </b>
          Sourcery CodeBench Lite for ARM EABI is now based on binutils
          version 2.21.
        </p><p><b>Assembler crash. </b>
          The assembler now warns when there is line information for
	  the <code class="literal">*ABS*</code> section, rather than crash.
	  This can occur when the <code class="code">.offset</code> directive is
	  used incorrectly.
        </p><p><b>Installer failure during upgrade. </b>
        Some recent releases were affected by an installer bug
        on Windows hosts that caused installing a newer version of
        Sourcery CodeBench Lite into the same directory to fail with the error
        <code class="literal">Sourcery CodeBench Lite for ARM EABI upgrade failed</code>.

          debugging C++ code.
        </p><p><b>Fix for crash in GDB. </b>
          A memory corruption bug in GDB has been fixed that under very rare
          circumstances made it crash or exhibit other unpredictable behavior.
          <span>
            On GNU/Linux hosts, this bug caused crashes with an error message
            similar to: <code class="literal">*** glibc detected *** arm-none-eabi-gdb:
            free(): invalid next size (normal): 0x09466198 ***</code>
            followed by a backtrace.
          </span>
        </p><p><b>GDB interrupt handling bug fix. </b>
	  A bug in GDB has been fixed that caused it to sometimes fail
	  to interrupt lengthy single-step operations (as by a
	  <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>C</strong></span>
	  when using GDB from the command line).
	</p><p><b>Fix debugger remote target interruption. </b>
	  A bug in GDB's handling of requests to interrupt execution on a
	  remote target has been fixed that caused it to stop the target but
	  not emit a stopped MI record.
	  
        </p><p><b>Fix GDB crash during connection to debug agent. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused GDB to crash while connecting
	  to any debug agent through standard IO where the debug agent
	  had detected an early error and terminated the communication.
        </p><p><b>GDB internal error fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused GDB to produce messages of
	  the form: <code class="literal">warning: (Internal error: pc 0x1000a0 in
	  read in psymtab, but not in symtab.)</code>
	  when taking the addresses of symbols from objects added with
	  the <code class="command">add-symbol-file</code> command.
        </p><p><b>Improved disassembler performance in the debugger. </b>
          GDB's disassembler has been improved to use more efficient memory
	  access on remote targets.
        </p><p><b>Fix GDB crash in debugging Thumb assembly routines. </b>
	  A bug in GDB has been fixed that caused a crash when debugging
	  Thumb assembly routines that switch stacks by writing the stack
	  pointer in the function prologue.
        </p><p><b>Debug Sprite option defaults. </b>
          The Sourcery CodeBench Debug Sprite now uses default option values
	  specified in board configuration files.  Options included in
	  the device URL override the default values.
        </p><p><b>Changes to host operating system requirements. </b>
          The minimum required Microsoft Windows OS needed to run
          Sourcery CodeBench Lite is now Windows XP (SP1).
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id373659"></a>A.1.2. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2011.03-42</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Variable Length Array (VLA) alignment bug. </b>
	  A compiler bug that resulted in incorrectly aligned variable length
	  arrays (VLA) in leaf functions has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Cortex-R5 support. </b>
          Sourcery G++ now includes support for ARM Cortex-R5
          processors.  To compile for these processors,
          use <code class="option">-mcpu=cortex-r5</code>. 
        </p><p><b>Inline assembly and volatile fields. </b>
	  A bug has been fixed that caused the compiler to incorrectly
	  reject inline <code class="code">asm</code> statements referring to volatile
	  class/struct fields with errors such as <code class="literal">error: output
	  number 1 not directly addressable</code>.
	</p><p><b>Fixed-point arithmetic support. </b>
          Experimental compiler support has been added for fixed-point
          arithmetic on ARM, as described in the draft ISO/IEC technical
          report TR 18037.  Specialized instructions defined in recent
          architecture versions for performing saturating arithmetic,
          etc. are used when available, but are not a prerequisite for
          using the new language features.  See
	  <a class="xref" href="sec-arm-fixed-point.html" title="3.5. Fixed-Point Arithmetic">Section 3.5, &#8220;Fixed-Point Arithmetic&#8221;</a> for further details.
        </p><p><b>C++ constructor bug fix. </b>
          A compiler bug has been fixed that caused incorrect code for C++
          constructors for some class hierarchies that use virtual inheritance
          and include empty classes.  At runtime, the incorrect constructors
          resulted in memory corruption or other errors.
        </p><p><b>Thumb debug information fix. </b>
	  A compiler bug that resulted in incorrect debug information
	  for Thumb code has been fixed.  The incorrect information
	  prevented single stepping through some code.
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler error with pointer casting. </b>
          A compiler bug has been fixed that caused internal compiler
          errors when accessing double-word memory locations with
	  casted pointers under ARM mode.
        </p><p><b>Unaligned access support. </b>
          The compiler now generates more efficient code for accessing
          packed data structures and for copying small blocks of
          unaligned data when targeting architectures that permit
          unaligned word/halfword accesses.  This feature can be
          controlled by the <code class="option">-munaligned-access</code> and
          <code class="option">-mno-unaligned-access</code> options, and is enabled
          by default for ARMv6 processors and above, except for ARMv6-M.
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler error under Thumb mode. </b>
          A compiler bug has been fixed that caused internal compiler
          errors when generating Thumb code.
        </p><p><b>Xilinx Zynq-7000 board support. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite now includes CS3 board support for the Xilinx Zynq-7000.
        </p><p><b>Debugging M-profile targets with third-party GDB stubs. </b>
	  A bug in GDB has been fixed that caused the error
	  <code class="literal">Remote 'g' packet reply is too long</code>
	  with ARMv6-M and ARMv7-M targets.
	  The error was reported when connecting to some third-party GDB
	  stubs, including SEGGER GDB Server and OpenOCD, but did not affect
	  the Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite.
	</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id373998"></a>A.1.3. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2011.03-13</h3></div></div></div><p><b>GCC fixes for <code class="option">-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</code>. </b>
	  GCC now honors <code class="option">-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</code>
	  when a bitfield is not declared volatile initially, but an
	  object including bit fields is cast to volatile.
	  Also, a bug was fixed that caused incorrect code to be generated
	  for some stores to volatile bit fields when
	  <code class="option">-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</code> is enabled.
        </p><p><b>Compiler optimization improvements. </b>
          The compiler has been enhanced with a number of optimization
	  improvements, including:
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
	      Smaller and faster code for compound conditionals.
	    </li><li>
	      Removal of superfluous sign and zero extensions.
	    </li><li>
	      Improved code for multiply-and-accumulate operations on ARM.
	    </li><li>
	      Faster code when tuning for Cortex-M series processors.
	    </li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler error with NEON intrinsics. </b>
          A compiler bug has been fixed that caused internal compiler
          errors when using certain NEON intrinsics.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.5.2. </b>
          Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM EABI is now based on GCC version 4.5.2.
        </p><p><b>GCC code generation bug for casts to <code class="code">volatile</code>
          types. </b>
          A compiler bug has been fixed that sometimes caused incorrect code
          for references to pointers to types with <code class="code">volatile</code> casts.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect optimization fix. </b>
          An optimizer bug that in rare cases caused incorrect code to
	  be generated for complex AND and OR expressions containing
	  redundant subexpressions has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect C++ warning fixed. </b>
          A bug in GCC has been fixed that caused spurious warnings
	  about lambda expressions in C++ code that does not use them.
        </p><p><b>GCC fixes for NEON in big-endian mode. </b>
          Several compiler bugs have been fixed that could lead to
          incorrect code when using NEON in big-endian mode. The problems
          only manifested when using the auto-vectorizer (enabled by
          default at the <code class="option">-O3</code> optimization level) with
          the <code class="option">-mvectorize-with-neon-quad</code> option.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect code for built-in comparison functions. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that sometimes caused GCC's built-in
	  comparison functions,
	  such as <code class="function">__builtin_isgreaterequal</code>, to
	  incorrectly raise exceptions when invoked on unordered
	  floating-point arguments.
        </p><p><b>C++ exception handling. </b>
          A defect in the implementation of the EH-ABI specification
	  has been fixed.  The defect affected the catching of pointer
	  types in code generated by the ARM <span class="trademark">RealView</span>® compiler but using
	  the Sourcery G++ runtime libraries.  The fix also retains
	  backward compatibility with existing GCC-compiled code.
        </p><p><b>GCC bug where accesses to volatile structure fields are optimized away. </b>
          A bug has been fixed where accesses to volatile fields of a structure
	  were sometimes incorrectly optimized away if the structure instance
	  was defined as non-volatile.
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler error fixes. </b>
          Two bugs have been fixed that caused compiler crashes in rare cases.
          The first bug involved code with multiple comparison operations,
          and the second one involved <code class="type">char</code> to <code class="type">int</code>
          conversion. 
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 assembler validation fix. </b>
	  The assembler now correctly rejects Thumb-2
	  <code class="literal">ADD</code>, <code class="literal">ADDS</code>,
	  <code class="literal">SUB</code>, and <code class="literal">SUBS</code>
	  instructions that have an invalid shift operand.
	  Previously, invalid shift values were accepted and
	  generated unpredictable instructions.
        </p><p><b>Objdump fix for multiple input files. </b>
          The Objdump utility did not produce correct disassembly
	  when processing multiple input files.  This has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>CS3 interrupt handlers. </b>
          CS3 now provides separate ISR functions for each core
	  processor exception, rather than aliasing them all to a
	  single interrupt handler.  This provides more useful backtrace
	  information in the debugger.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id374697"></a>A.1.4. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2010.09-51</h3></div></div></div><p><b>GCC fix for duplicated symbols. </b>
          A GCC optimizer bug that caused multiple definitions of
	  local symbols has been fixed.  Code affected by the bug
	  was rejected by the assembler.
        </p><p><b>NEON code generation fix. </b>
          A GCC bug has been fixed that resulted in an assembler error
          <code class="literal">VFP/Neon double precision register expected</code>.
        </p><p><b>Static data size improvement at <code class="option">-Os</code>. </b>
	  When optimizing for size, the compiler no longer implicitly
	  adds padding bytes to align static and local arrays on
	  word boundaries.
	  This fixes static data size regressions introduced since GCC 4.4.
	  The additional alignment is still used when optimizing for speed.
        </p><p><b>New <code class="option">-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</code> option. </b>
          The compiler has a new
	  option, <code class="option">-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</code>, which
	  forces access to a volatile structure member using the width
	  that conforms to its type.
	  <span>
	    This option is enabled by default to conform to the ARM EABI.
	  </span>
	  
	  Refer to the GCC manual for details. 
        </p><p><b>Internal compiler error fixes. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the compiler to crash
          on code containing a <code class="literal">typedef</code> alias
          for <code class="type">__builtin_va_list</code> with option
	  <code class="option">-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</code>.
	  
	  A second bug has been fixed that caused a crash
	  when compiling code using C99 variable-length arrays.
	  <span>
	    Additionally, a compiler crash on code using
	    64-bit integer multiplications with NEON vectorization enabled
	    has also been fixed.
          </span>
	</p><p><b>NEON narrowing-move instructions. </b>
	  The compiler now supports narrowing-move instructions
	  when auto-vectorizing for NEON.  Loops accessing arrays of
	  <code class="type">char</code> or <code class="type">short</code> values are now more
	  likely to be vectorized.
	</p><p><b>Improved support for atomic memory builtins. </b>
	   The compiler support for built-in atomic memory access
	   operations on ARMv7 targets has been improved.
	   These builtins are documented in the GCC manual.
	 </p><p><b>Linker debug information fix. </b>
          A bug in linker processing of debug information has been
          fixed.  The bug sometimes prevented the Sourcery G++ debugger from
          displaying source code if the executable was linked
	  with the <code class="option">--gc-sections</code> option.
        </p><p><b>Absolute branch bug fixes. </b>
	  A bug that caused the assembler to crash on a branch
	  to an absolute address has been fixed.  Linker handling of the
	  resulting relocations has also been improved.  Previously this
	  caused an invalid switch to ARM mode on ARMv7-M devices.
        </p><p><b><code class="code">VMOV</code> instruction bug fix. </b>
          A bug that caused the assembler to incorrectly reject
          certain valid immediate operands for the <code class="code">VMOV</code>
          instruction has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Debugger warnings quieted. </b>
	  GDB no longer prints <code class="literal">RMT ERROR</code> diagnostics
	  on connection to the Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite.
	  In spite of the alarming appearance of the messages, they were
	  not actually indicative of a serious problem.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id375068"></a>A.1.5. Changes in Sourcery G++ Lite 2010.09-22</h3></div></div></div><p><b>Changes to Sourcery G++ version numbering. </b>
          Sourcery G++ product and Lite toolchains now uniformly use
	  a version numbering scheme of the form 2012.03-56.
	  The major and minor parts of the version number, in this
	  case 2012.03, identify the release branch,
	  while the final component is a build number within the branch.
	  There are also new preprocessor macros defined by the compiler

        </p><p><b>GCC fix for reference to undefined label. </b>
          A bug in the optimizer that caused GCC to emit references
	  to undefined labels has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Precision improvement with vectorization enabled. </b>
          The GCC auto-vectorizer no longer uses
          NEON floating-point instructions unless the
          <code class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</code> option (implied
          by <code class="option">-ffast-math</code>) is specified.  This is because
          NEON hardware does not fully support the IEEE 754 standard for
          floating-point arithmetic.  In particular, very small quantities
          may be flushed to zero.
        </p><p><b>Alignment attributes. </b>
	  A bug has been fixed that caused the compiler to ignore
	  alignment attributes of C++ static member variables where
	  the attribute was present on the definition, but not the
	  declaration.
	</p><p><b><code class="code">naked</code> attribute semantics. </b>
          The <code class="code">naked</code> function attribute now also implies the
	  <code class="code">noinline</code> and <code class="code">noclone</code> attributes.
	  This fixes bugs resulting from invalid optimizations of functions
	  with this attribute.
        </p><p><b>Stack corruption bug fix. </b>
          A bug in GCC has been fixed that caused stack corruption
	  in functions with the <code class="code">interrupt</code> attribute.
        </p><p><b>GCC bug fix for push multiple instruction generation. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused GCC to generate incorrect
	  push multiple instructions, causing an assembler warning
	  <code class="literal">register range not in ascending order</code>.
        </p><p><b>Thumb-2 internal compiler error fix. </b>
	  A bug has been fixed that caused the compiler to crash
	  when compiling Thumb-2 code using 64-bit integer arithmetic.
        </p><p><b>Compiler optimization improvements. </b>
          The compiler has been enhanced with a number of optimization
	  improvements, including:
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
	      More efficient assignment for structures containing bitfields.
	    </li><li>
	      Better code for initializing C++ arrays with explicit
	      element initializers.
	    </li><li>
	      Improved logic for eliminating/combining redundant comparisons in
	      code with nested conditionals.
	    </li><li>
	      Better selection of loop variables, resulting in fewer
	      temporaries and more efficient register usage.
	    </li><li>
	      More optimization of references to globals in
	      position-independent code.
	    </li><li>
	      Various Thumb code generation improvements.
	    </li><li>
              Better code when constant addresses are used as arguments to
              inline assembly statements.
            </li><li>
	      Better code for copying small constant strings.
	    </li><li>
	      Improved tuning for Cortex-M4 processors.
	    </li><li>
	      Cortex-A9 specific tuning for VFP and NEON instructions.
	    </li><li>
	      Use of more NEON features.
	    </li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p><b>Preprocessor symbols for floating-point calling convention. </b>
          Built-in preprocessor symbols <code class="symbol">__ARM_PCS</code> and
          <code class="symbol">__ARM_PCS_VFP</code> are now defined to indicate
          the current floating-point calling convention.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.5.1. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ Lite for ARM EABI is now based on GCC version 4.5.1.
	  For more information about changes from GCC version 4.4 that was
	  included in previous releases, see
	  <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.5/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>New <code class="option">-Wdouble-promotion</code> warning
	option. </b>
	  The compiler has a new
	  option, <code class="option">-Wdouble-promotion</code>, which enables
	  warnings about implicit promotions of <code class="type">float</code>
	  values to <code class="type">double</code>.  This option is useful when
	  compiling code for processors (such as ARM Cortex-M4) that
	  have hardware support for single-precision floating-point
	  arithmetic only, where unintentional use of double precision
	  results in dramatically slower code.
       </p><p><b>Linker bug fix. </b>
          A bug that caused the linker error <code class="literal">relocation
	  truncated to fit: R_ARM_THM_JUMP24</code> when linking
	  some Thumb-2 applications has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Assembler PC-relative store fix. </b>
          A bug that caused the assembler to reject some valid
	  PC-relative store instructions has been fixed.  It now
	  issues a warning instead for architectures where these
	  instructions are deprecated.
        </p><p><b>ARMv7-A linker bug fix. </b>
	  A bug in the linker support for <code class="option">--fix-cortex-a8</code>,
	  which is enabled by default when linking ARMv7-A objects, has been
	  fixed.  Programs affected by the bug sometimes crashed with
	  segmentation fault or illegal instruction errors.
	</p><p><b>Smaller C++ programs with <code class="option">-g</code>. </b>
          An assembler bug has been fixed that caused unnecessary references
	  to exception-handling routines from C++ programs when debug
	  information is enabled.  For programs that do not otherwise
	  use exceptions, this change results in smaller code size.
        </p><p><b>Additional validation in the assembler. </b>
          The assembler now diagnoses an error, instead of producing
          an invalid object file, when directives such as
          <code class="literal">.hidden</code> are missing operands.
          
        </p><p><b>Assembler PC-relative load fix. </b>
	  An assembler bug that caused the assembler to reject some
	  references to global symbols has been fixed.  This
	  bug affected Thumb instructions of the form
	  <code class="literal">ldr r0, <em class="replaceable"><code>symbol</code></em></code>.
        </p><p><b>Strip bug fix. </b>
          A bug in the <code class="command">strip</code> and
	  <code class="command">objcopy</code> utilities, which resulted in
	  stripped object files that the linker could not recognize,
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Binutils update. </b>
	  The binutils package has been updated to version
	  2.20.51.20100809 from the FSF trunk.  This update includes
	  numerous bug fixes.
        </p><p><b>Additional alignment in CS3-defined linker scripts. </b>
	  Sourcery G++ now ensures 8-byte alignment at additional points
	  in CS3-defined linker scripts.  Previously, placing a symbol
	  in certain sections broke the initialization of
	  the <code class="literal">.data</code> and/or <code class="literal">.bss</code>
	  sections.
        </p><p><b>Newlib update. </b>
          The Newlib package has been updated to version 1.18.0, with
          additions from the community CVS trunk as of 2010-08-12.
          This update provides additional wide-character functions,
          along with other bug fixes and enhancements.
        </p><p><b><code class="function">malloc</code> fix. </b>
          A bug that sometimes caused <code class="function">free</code> to
          dereference an invalid address has been fixed.  The bug was
          caused by incorrect handling
          within <code class="function">malloc</code> of calls
          to <code class="function">sbrk</code> from outside
          of <code class="function">malloc</code>.
        </p><p><b>
	  Improved support for debugging <span class="trademark">
	  RealView</span>® C++ programs
	. </b>
	  GDB has been enhanced to handle some debug information
	  contained in binaries produced by the
	  ARM <span class="trademark">RealView</span>®
	  compiler.  Formerly, GDB sometimes crashed on programs
	  which use C++ templates.
          Another bug has been fixed that caused GDB to fail to place
          breakpoints in binaries produced by the
          ARM <span class="trademark">RealView</span>®
          compiler when the source file location for the breakpoint was
          specified as an absolute pathname.
	</p><p><b>GDB update. </b>
	  The included version of GDB has been updated to
	  7.2.50.20100908.  This update adds numerous bug fixes and
	  new features, including improved C++ language support,
	   a new command to save breakpoints to a file,
	   a new
	  convenience variable <code class="varname">$_thread</code> that holds
	  the number of the current thread, among many other
	  improvements.
	</p><p><b>GDB crash fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused GDB to crash on launch if
          the environment variable <code class="literal">CYGPATH</code> is set
          to a program that does not exist or cannot be executed.
        </p><p><b>Debug Sprite abnormal termination bug fix. </b>
          The Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite no longer terminates abnormally
          if GDB is killed while the target is waiting for semihosted
          I/O to complete.  The bug was only triggered when running GDB
          on a Windows host.
        </p><p><b>Semihosting support for <code class="function">gettimeofday</code>. </b>
          The Sourcery G++ Debug Sprite now provides a semihosted implementation
	  of the <code class="function">gettimeofday</code> C library function.
