       unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed modified to
       the extent necessary and possible to render it valid and
       enforceable. In any event, the unenforceability or
       invalidity of any provision shall not affect any other
       provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall
       continue in full force and effect, and be construed and
       enforced, as if such provision had not been included, or
       had been modified as above provided, as the case may be.
   18. Arbitration.
       Except for actions to protect intellectual property
       rights and to enforce an arbitrator's decision hereunder,
       all disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of or
       relating to this Agreement or a breach thereof shall be
       submitted to and finally resolved by arbitration under
       the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA)
       then in effect. There shall be one arbitrator, and such
       arbitrator shall be chosen by mutual agreement of the
       parties in accordance with AAA rules. The arbitration

       conducted by telephone or online. The arbitrator shall
       apply the laws of the State of California, USA to all
       issues in dispute. The controversy or claim shall be
       arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be
       consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or
       controversy of any other party. The findings of the
       arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties, and
       may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction for
       enforcement. Enforcements of any award or judgment shall
       be governed by the United Nations Convention on the
       Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.
       Should either party file an action contrary to this
       provision, the other party may recover attorney's fees
       and costs up to $1000.00.
   19. Jurisdiction And Venue.
       The courts of Placer County in the State of California,
       USA and the nearest U.S. District Court shall be the
       exclusive jurisdiction and venue for all legal
       proceedings that are not arbitrated under this Agreement.
   20. Independent Contractors.
       The relationship of the parties is that of independent
       contractor, and nothing herein shall be construed to
       create a partnership, joint venture, franchise,
       employment, or agency relationship between the parties.
       Licensee shall have no authority to enter into agreements
       of any kind on behalf of Mentor Graphics and shall not
       have the power or authority to bind or obligate Mentor
       Graphics in any manner to any third party.
   21. Force Majeure.
       Neither Mentor Graphics nor Licensee shall be liable for
       damages for any delay or failure of delivery arising out
       of causes beyond their reasonable control and without
       their fault or negligence, including, but not limited to,
       Acts of God, acts of civil or military authority, fires,
       riots, wars, embargoes, or communications failure.
   22. Miscellaneous.
       This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of
       the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
       Agreement and merges all prior communications,
       representations, and agreements. This Agreement may be
       modified only by a written agreement signed by the
       parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
       unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be
       reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
       enforceable. This Agreement shall be construed under the
       laws of the State of California, USA, excluding rules
       regarding conflicts of law. The application of the United
       Nations Convention of Contracts for the International
       Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. This license is
       written in English, and English is its controlling
       language.
